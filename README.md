this is a basic main file for an app idea i had a while back
- the app will block certain chosen applications on ones phone when it is at a certain location, for example school or work, in order to increase productivity
- this makes it harder to circumvent the blocks, or avoids forgetting to use devices like Brick to block the apps before you leave to work or school
- it would need a server pinging ones location maybe every 5-10 minutes, to start i would probably just use a raspberry pi at my house
